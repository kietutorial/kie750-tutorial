#The Normal Basic Generated KIE Sample Project

###Create a Drools Project in Eclipse
I generated from eclipse:
File -> New -> Drools -> Drools Project ->
Select "Create a project and populate it with some example files..." ->
Select Build the Project using: Maven
Group ID: com.aikiinc
Artifact ID: kierulesengine_00_normalprj

* Note: 
Of course you have to install the "Red Hat CodeReady Studio" plugin.

###The generated project
It has the various KIE test code, "test", as a java application called via main() method. Here are the three java codes:<br/>
DecisionTableTest.java<br/>
DroolTest.java<br/>
ProcessTest.java<br/>

###These are not test?
I don't think these are real Junit type of test? But they do show how to simply wire the KIE code together and run facts.

Next is to create refactor and create real test. See jbpm_prj02.
