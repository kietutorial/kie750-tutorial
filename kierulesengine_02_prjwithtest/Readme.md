#The Basic KIE Generated Code Using JUnit

###Three Created Test
In the src/test/java we have three JUnit code modules:<br/>
DecisionTableTest.java<br/>
DroolTest.java<br/>
ProcessTest.java<br/>

The original "test" using the java application main() are removed. See kiebasic_prj00.

The Message.java was extracted to the package com.sample.

###There Is A Test Test Utility
KieUtil.java refactored all the plumbing, utility code, to get the KieSession and fire decision table, JBPM process and drools rule.
